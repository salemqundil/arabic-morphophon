##  **Issues Identified & Solutions**

### 1. **BibTeX Field Completeness**
**Problem:** Some BibTeX entries missing recommended fields
**Solution:** Enhanced BibTeX entries with complete field sets

### 2. **Author Name Consistency**
**Problem:** Inconsistent author names between engines
- Found: "Arabic NLP Team" vs "Arabic NLP Professional Team"
**Solution:** Standardize to "Arabic NLP Team" across all components

### 3. **Version Number Consistency**
**Problem:** Mixed version numbers (2.0.0 vs 1.0.0)
**Solution:** Main project uses 2.0.0, individual engines use 1.0.0 (correct approach)
