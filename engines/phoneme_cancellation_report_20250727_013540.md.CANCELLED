## üîí QUARANTINE LOCATION

All cancelled files have been moved to:
```
C:\Users\Administrator\new engine\engines\quarantine_phoneme_sound_code
```

## üõ°Ô∏è SAFETY MEASURES

1. ‚úÖ Original files preserved in quarantine
2. ‚úÖ Stub files created to prevent import errors
3. ‚úÖ No Arabic language content destroyed
4. ‚úÖ Only sound/phoneme processing cancelled
5. ‚úÖ Easy to restore if needed

## üîÑ RESTORATION

To restore cancelled files:
```bash
# Move files back from quarantine
cp -r quarantine_phoneme_sound_code/* .
# Remove stub files
rm [stub file names]
```

## ‚úÖ OPERATION COMPLETE

All phoneme/sound-related coding has been safely cancelled.
The system is now free of risky sound processing patterns.
